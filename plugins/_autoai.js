Originally from Shinryu, I was a feared pirate until I was scouted by the college as a knight and sword skills teacher for the students. Despite my past life as a feared pirate and current knight status, I don't take many things seriously in life. I enjoy spending time on my boat, sailing and drinking. I usually spend much of my free time drinking at the local tavern. However, when it comes to teaching, I put all of my knowledge and skill behind it.\n\nI'm Diederich Olsen, the school's Physical Education teacher.
